To use the VPN application, you will need access to an Orchid account. The Orchid accounts hold the funds that pay providers through the nanopayment system and users are responsible for managing those accounts on the blockchain. Each account has its own public/private keypair, a special funder wallet that can control the account and the account makeup (deposit & balance), which determines how efficient the account is at transmitting payments. How to get an Orchid account Purchase an account (iOS/macOS only feature) custodied by Orchid Create and self-custody an Orchid account using the Orchid dApp Access an account that was shared with you Purchased Orchid accounts (iOS/macOS only feature) In the Orchid iOS and macOS apps, it is possible to simply purchase an Orchid account from Orchid Labs using an in-app purchase. These are distinct from Orchid accounts created in the dApp. Currently these accounts are pre-filled with currency and the credentials for them are custodied by Orchid Labs. That means that once an account is purchased, the account cannot be refilled and the deposit cannot be increased if market conditions change. We are aware of this critical limitation and will address it in our next iteration of the in-app purchase system. For now, email contact@orchid.com if your purchased account has any issues and we can promptly resolve them. Orchid account efficiency Orchid\u2019s nanopayments work on a principle: that sending someone a scratch lottery ticket with a 1/100 chance of winning $100 instead of sending $1 will save you transaction fees and transmit the same amount of value over time. The amount of value transmitted per \u201cwinning\u201d ticket divided by the fees gives the account\u2019s efficiency which is displayed in the app and dApp. When the efficiency of an account drops below 0%, providers will no longer accept payments from that account because the network fees are greater than the amount of value they could receive from a winning ticket. Accounts with 0% efficiency will not work with the VPN service and will warn the user with a red \u201c!\u201d. There are three major factors that affect efficiency: * The size of the deposit of the account which determines the face value of the tickets * The network fees for a given moment in time * Currency conversion of the currency held in the account to the currency used to pay network fees Efficiency example Imagine an Orchid account with a 150 OXT deposit. The account will issue tickets with a 75 OXT face value. Providers therefore are getting a tiny chance at \u201cwinning\u201d 75 OXT for each ticket they accept for service. Providers must pay the network fee to claim the 75 OXT. Since the OXT denominated account is on Ethereum, the network fees are paid in ETH. So the provider calculates the current ETH gas price in OXT and makes sure that the fee is not greater than 75 OXT. When the network fees the provider pays to claim the 75 OXT are greater than 75 OXT of value, the provider does not accept payments from that account and that account has a 0% efficiency. Deposit The deposit is required to accept service and is verified by providers. The deposit prevents double spending and in general, the deposit maintains good standing on the network. The size of the deposit determines the face value of the tickets sent from the user to the provider. The face value refers to the amount of OXT that a provider claims when they receive a winning off-chain nanopayment. Currently the face value is set to equal half of the deposit. When an Orchid account is created, the deposit is \u201clocked\u201d and cannot be withdrawn from the account until it is \u201cunlocked\u201d and a 24-hr cooling period has passed. Size of Deposit Market conditions are constantly changing. This includes fluctuations in network fees (Ethereum gas amounts) and changes in the conversion rate from the currency held in the account to the currency to pay network fees (OXT -> ETH). When the account efficiency gets low, it is a good idea to add additional OXT to the deposit of the account to increase the efficiency. The dApp has an efficiency slider that displays the amount of deposit necessary to achieve that efficiency. Increasing the size of the deposit increases the efficiency of the account by increasing the face value of the tickets. Balance The balance portion of the Orchid account is the amount of currency held to pay providers. When the account is in use, the tickets are backed by funds in the balance. When a ticket \u201cwins\u201d, the face value of the ticket is withdrawn from the user\u2019s account balance and deposited into the provider\u2019s account with an on-chain transaction. As a practical matter, while using the Orchid VPN, you will notice that the balance remains unchanged for long periods of time. That is because you can often receive significant amounts of bandwidth, on average, before a payment ticket \u201cwins\u201d, funds are claimed and your balance is adjusted. The balance of an Orchid account can be thought of as a number of tickets. The size of the ticket is governed by the deposit, as the network requires two tickets worth of deposit for payments to be accepted. The two tickets worth of deposit is required to prevent double spending attacks. So for example, if the account\u2019s deposit size is 150 OXT and there is 225 OXT in the balance, the Orchid account has 3 tickets worth of balance because the size of each ticket is 75 OXT (deposit / 2) and there are 3 tickets worth of balance (total balance / ticket size). The dApp has an Add Funds screen to add additional balance to your account. Tickets A ticket is a nanopayment sent from a user to a provider to pay for service. The ticket has a probability of winning along with a face value, which is the amount of currency the provider receives if the ticket \u201cwins\u201d. The face value of a ticket is set at half of the deposit in the Orchid account. While this is hard coded in the app right now, in the future the face value of tickets could vary, depending on market conditions and to optimize for variance. However, the upper limit of ticket size is governed by the deposit, and the max ticket size is always half of the deposit. Orchid accounts with very few tickets will experience a high amount of variance due to the nature of probability. Variance There is an important concept to consider when using Orchid -- variance. Since tickets have a probability of a win, it is likely that a winning ticket will be claimed either faster or slower than is expected. For a quick example, imagine you have an Orchid account with one ticket worth of balance. As you start using the service, a winning ticket is issued immediately because you are \u201cunlucky\u201d. Your balance then goes to 0 and you will need to add funds. This is an example of not getting what you expect due to variance. The inverse can also happen: that is to receive much more service than expected. To combat variance, Orchid accounts need more tickets worth of service. That way, the probability of a winning ticket being issued before or after you would expect is mitigated. As of now, Orchid recommends at least 3 tickets worth of service in your account balance. Technical Parts of an Orchid account The makeup of an Orchid account is important for understanding how to manage it, and how the different components work together. Ultimately the technical details of the account are dictated by the nanopayment smart contract which holds the funds and allows users to interact with their accounts. The Orchid funder wallet The funder wallet is a block-chain address that corresponds to the wallet address that funded the account. The owner of that wallet has complete control over the Orchid account and can add or remove funds, along with all the other operations available in the Orchid account manager. Simply put, the funder wallet is the custodian of the Orchid account. Without the keys to the funder wallet, no functions can be performed on the account, such as adding/removing funds, unlocking/locking the deposit and moving funds between balance and deposit. If the keys to a funder wallet are lost, the associated Orchid account will still function, but the user cannot add funds, remove funds or make any changes to the account. You will be able to use the account while it\u2019s efficiency is above 0%, until the balance is reduced to 0. If the deposit is lost and if the account efficiency drops below 0%, there is no way to add to the deposit. The Orchid signer Orchid accounts utilize their own keypair, the signer. The private portion of the key or \u201csecret\u201d is used by the client to sign tickets. The signer key is therefore a core technical property of the Orchid account and is the key bit of information that is shared when an Orchid account is shared between people or devices. The public portion of the signer, the signer address, is used when funding the Orchid account. The funding transaction that takes funds from the funder wallet and into the nanopayment contract requires the funds to be linked to a signer address. In the Orchid dApp, the signer address is required before a new Orchid account can be created. The signer address is used by providers to ensure the funds in an Orchid account correspond to a ticket they receive for service. The address can also be used to lookup information about the account on-chain. The signer is generated when a custom Orchid account is created (Android only feature) or when creating an Orchid account in the dApp. Sharing Orchid accounts There\u2019s no limit to the number of people or devices that a single Orchid account can be shared with. The account is specified by the funder wallet and the signer secret. The QR code sharing feature in the app just encodes this information. The account information can also be copied and directly pasted into the client app as text. The Orchid account format looks like this: account={ protocol: \"orchid\", funder: \" \", secret: \" \" } Note - the public funder wallet address starts with 0x, while the signer secret does not use the 0x prefix. Orchid Account Troubleshooting Deposit size too small Both the Orchid client app and the Orchid web dApp will display a warning when the Orchid account efficiency or balance is too low for usage. There are a few solutions when you see this error. Turn off Orchid and wait for network fees to drop A primary cause of a deposit that is too low could be a sudden spike in network transaction fees. If, for example, your Orchid account is on the Ethereum chain with OXT in it, then the Ethereum gas costs could suddenly spike, which causes your Orchid account\u2019s efficiency to drop below 0. Waiting for network fees to settle is all that is needed for account efficiency to rise back up, and to get it working again. For in-app purchased accounts (iOS/macOS only feature) Orchid attempts to pre-fill Orchid accounts with enough of a deposit at the time of purchase, but market conditions can change rapidly. Email Orchid support at contact@orchid.com to fix problems with purchased accounts. In the near future, users will be able to manage their accounts through additional purchases in the client app. For now, there is no way for the user to fix purchased accounts with low efficiency. Do not try to fix purchased accounts in the dApp, as there is no way to do that correctly. We apologize for the inconvenience until this new system is online. For Orchid accounts created with the DApp The Orchid dApp can add funds to the account\u2019s deposit, which will improve the Orchid account efficiency and eliminate the warning, allowing the app to start working. To add funds, connect the funder wallet used to create the Orchid account and click on the Add Funds tab. What is the difference between Balance and Deposit in my Orchid Account? The balance is the collateral for the tickets sent from the user to the provider. Over time, as winning tickets are issued from your Orchid app, the Orchid account balance will drop. The deposit is the Orchid token held in escrow to disincentivize double spending on the network. This amount never depletes and can be withdrawn after a 24hr \"unlock\" period.","title":"Orchid Accounts"},{"location":"accounts/#what-are-accounts","text":"Orchid accounts are the center of the payment system that allows Orchid\u2019s decentralized VPN application to function.

Basic Internet connections function by transmitting packets of data between two hosts (computers). In order to find their way, packets contain both a source and destination IP address. As packets move from the destination to the source, different routers and physical infrastructure require both of these addresses for the two-way connection to be established and maintained. This means that instantly and over time, the owners of the physical infrastructure are in a position to build a profile of Internet usage on their paying user (you!) and also to block content as the owner sees fit. Typically these infrastructure owners are ISPs \u2014 mobile carriers providing phone data connections, home cable Internet providers, WiFi hotspot operators, and any Internet backbone operators that have peering agreements with user-facing ISPs. In all these cases, the ISP is in an advantaged position to monitor and/or restrict Internet usage. It is common in many countries for ISPs to restrict content so that users cannot load certain websites. If you are not happy with or do not trust your existing ISP(s), by using Orchid you can currently limit their knowledge to knowing only that you are sending and receiving bytes through Orchid, and completely block their ability to mess with the details of your traffic, unblocking the previously blocked content. They either block all of Orchid or nothing, so if things continue to work after turning on Orchid, then your ISP has allowed \"Orchid in general\" and cannot manipulate the individual bytes between you and the rest of the Internet, granting you access to the entire Internet. How can the Orchid app help me with privacy today? The goal with the Orchid app is to give users insight and control over the network connection of their device. To gain privacy, users configure a circuit in Orchid by setting up an Orchid account and funding it with OXT. Then the Orchid app connects to the Orchid network and selects a node using Orchid\u2019s linear stake-weighted algorithm to serve as a VPN and pays for bandwidth via a continuous stream of tiny OXT nanopayments . In a single-hop circuit configuration, Orchid provides: Protection from websites seeing your real IP address and physical location Protection from your ISP seeing what websites you are visiting and when Access to the open Internet--once a user can connect to Orchid, they are not restricted by ISP level firewalls and can browse the entire Internet freely A potential problem with using only a single VPN provider is that the provider running the single node circuit knows both your IP address and the content you are accessing. If the provider maintains logs, those logs could be sold to advertisers or otherwise used against you. In the current VPN marketplace, it is hard to know who is maintaining logs and who is not. For Orchid nodes, we have developed a flexible curation system that gives users a way to pick whom to trust. Another solution is to trust no single provider with enough information to know both who you are and what information you are accessing. To that end, Orchid supports an advanced feature that allows users to configure multi-hop routes by stringing together multiple nodes into a flexible multi-hop circuit. Orchid currently supports several underlying protocols including the native Orchid VPN protocol and OpenVPN, allowing users to mix and match Orchid nodes with traditional VPN nodes. While the potential is there to protect the user from any one provider knowing enough information to reveal their circuit, this is an advanced feature that is currently \"use at your own risk\". How is Orchid private given that it has public payments on Ethereum? The Orchid app pays for the circuit by sending a continuous stream of tiny nanopayments to providers for the duration of the connection. While the nanopayment architecture locks user funds into a smart contract and only issues on-chain payments to providers very rarely, occasional winning tickets do result in OXT macro-payments posted on the public Ethereum blockchain. When that happens, the user\u2019s Ethereum address, the provider\u2019s Ethereum address, and a timestamp are stored publically on the Ethereum blockchain. Note that the payment address of the provider is not a mapping to any single server; instead it is an arbitrary (and potentially temporary) payment address that the provider created specifically to receive funds. Also, the frequency of how often on-chain payments occur is configurable. All information gained by a potential network attacker is an advantage. However, consider exactly what information is revealed. For an Orchid user running a single hop circuit: the provider sees the user\u2019s payment address when it accepts service, along with the user\u2019s real IP address and the destination addresses that the user is connecting to (if it maintains logs). Once a rare on-chain payment is made, the user\u2019s payment address and provider\u2019s payment address are stored on Ethereum with a timestamp available to the public. When considering anonymity, it is important to understand if the user is linked to the OXT used in their circuit. Worst case, if the user purchased OXT on an exchange with their real identity, or the VPN provider used in the circuit maintained logs, then either of those two entities could be compelled to give information that could deanonymize the user. Similarly, a user who paid for a VPN service that maintained logs with a credit card could be deanonymized with just one entity being compelled. A multi-hop circuit affords greater network protections, but to setup a multi-hop Orchid circuit, it would be naive to pay for each hop from the same Ethereum wallet. In that configuration, each provider would be able to see that wallet\u2019s address and potentially use that address to get information about the user. To mitigate that, a better way to setup multi-hop circuits would be to use different wallet addresses for each Orchid hop. If every wallet address is independently dissociated from the user, the full circuit might be quite difficult to link back to the user. Again, multi-hop circuits in Orchid are an advanced feature; use at your own risk. Orchid is working on additional features to mitigate payment leakage, such as onion payment routing. The idea of this technique is to help obfuscate payments by routing them through several layers of indirection (paying Alice to pay Bob to pay Charlie). The payments then take a different random route than the traffic, preventing the rare occasional public payment records from indirectly revealing route information. Can Orchid nodes monitor network traffic? Yes, providers on Orchid could monitor the bytes that come in and out of the Orchid node. However, all traffic carried over Orchid between hops from the user to the exit is encrypted at the Orchid protocol level, which is an additional layer of encryption. The final exit traffic is then decrypted by the exit node and sent to the destination. In many cases the underlying traffic will also be encrypted with protocols such as TLS, providing at least two layers of encryption. However, not all traffic on the Internet is encrypted and Orchid doesn\u2019t fix that problem. The last hop configured in the active circuit will need to send the user requests out onto the Internet. So if the user sends an HTTP request, which has no SSL/TLS encryption, Orchid will honor that request and cleartext information would be revealed to the Orchid node. For this reason, you should always use SSL/TLS for sensitive Internet connections, even on Orchid. And even SSL/TLS encryption leaves metadata that the Orchid node could monitor, including the destination address, hostname, packet sizes and the timing of packets. Using Orchid\u2019s multi-hop feature with a three hop circuit would compartmentalize the information any one provider could monitor. With a properly configured multi-hop circuit the origin and destination of the traffic would be anonymized from any one provider, however, that is an advanced feature which is currently \"use at your own risk\". The way the different Orchid hops are funded has an impact on information leakage that could potentially de-anonymize. Lastly, the Orchid client randomly selects from a \"curated list\" of providers. This adds an additional layer of protection as users could pick or make their own curated list of providers that they trust or someone that they trust, trusts. Orchid has a default list of trusted providers that ships with the Orchid app. So I'm totally private and anonymous when I use a VPN like Orchid? No. Orchid is a tool that keeps private certain types of information from ISPs, websites, and providers. Orchid adds layers that separate you from the content you are trying to access. If you login to Amazon, the website will know that it is you and can build out information about what you are doing on their website, even with Orchid enabled. However, your local ISP or network provider will not know you are visiting Amazon. Amazon will not know where you are in the world, and will not get your real IP address. If using at least three hops, no single provider will know your IP address and know that you are accessing Amazon. Also consider that Orchid is a VPN and that all VPNs have vulnerabilities at the software level. Typical modern browsers that are not \"hardened\" run all sorts of \u201cactive content\u201d such as Java, Javascript, Adobe Flash, Adobe Shockwave, QuickTime, RealAudio, ActiveX controls, and VBScript and other binary applications. This code runs at the operating system level with user account access, meaning they can access anything your user account can access. These technologies could store cookies, bypass proxy settings, store other types of data and share information directly to other sites on the Internet. Therefore, these technologies must be disabled in the browser you are using to improve your security in conjunction with using Orchid. Other metadata such as the size of the browser window, type of pointing device used and other unique information could be used to \"fingerprint\" the user and potentially de-anonymize. These browser fingerprinting attacks could affect any VPN users, Orchid included. Hardened browsers can help reduce or eliminate the user\u2019s visible browser fingerprint. Also certain apps or code running on your device could send de-anonymizing data out to the Internet or third parties. No VPN can prevent attacks from arbitrary software running on your device, such as malware or a virus. Furthermore, there is active network security research into \"traffic fingerprinting\" attacks that attempt to reveal private information by monitoring encrypted connections. By watching the timing and size of packets, an adversary monitoring an encrypted connection could get a good idea if a particular user is watching a video, browsing the Internet or downloading a large file, just based on the timing and size of packets. Further analysis could reveal what websites are visited by seeing the sequence of things that are loaded\u2014 again, the timing and size of packets along with when requests are made. Orchid is researching \"bandwidth burning\" and related techniques to help obfuscate a user\u2019s traffic against these advanced packet timing and size analysis attacks. Technology How does the Orchid token (OXT) work? OXT is a \"pre-mined\" cryptocurrency based on the ERC-20 standard that will be used to decentralize trust between buyers and sellers in the Orchid marketplace. It also functions as a tool to promote security and healthy market dynamics, as providers can adjust their OXT stake to remain competitive. Read more about OXT here . How do curated lists work on Orchid? The Orchid client calls an on-chain \u2018curated list\u2019 smart contract which filters the viable nodes on Orchid (that is, nodes that have properly staked) into a custom subset. Initial releases of the official Orchid client will use this feature to prevent certain kinds of attacks from malicious exit nodes (e.g. SSL downgrade attacks) by using a default list consisting of trusted VPN partners. Overall, the curated lists are a federated reputation solution for determining what VPN providers on Orchid you can trust. The system is fully programmable, exists on-chain and is Turing complete. The list function can take information as an argument, and then use that information to determine, for any given Orchid node, whether you want to connect to that node or not. The official Orchid client has a default list and can select from different lists. Eventually we expect well known third parties to emerge as curators. Given that this system is on-chain, an entity such as a DAO could manage a list too. The curated list mechanism is a means for the importation of external reputational trust to supplement the economic incentive based trust provided by node staking. What is the Orchid Protocol? The Orchid software is designed to use a custom VPN protocol, similar in scope to OpenVPN or WireGuard. The Orchid protocol is designed for high-performance networking and runs on top of WebRTC, a common web standard, widely used to transmit video and audio from inside browsers. Our protocol is intended to allow users to request access to remote network resources and pay for these resources using OXT via a nanopayments system. Staking What is Staking in Orchid? Staking is a process where one deposits and locks up an asset into an illiquid contract or mechanism in exchange for revenue or rewards. Orchid providers stake OXT tokens in an Ethereum smart contract (the directory) to advertize their services to clients. Orchid clients then select providers randomly, weighted by proportional stake, so that the probability of picking a particular provider is equal to their fraction of the total stake. Anyone else can also stake on a provider\u2019s address, allowing a form of \"delegated staking\". Any OXT holder can stake their OXT tokens on providers of their choosing. There are no automatic benefits of staking on someone else\u2019s behalf, but the staking mechanism could be combined with a revenue sharing contract between the staker and the stakee. Is Orchid Staking like Proof of Stake? Staking in Orchid is similar to proof of stake systems only in the sense of using stake as a linear weighting mechanism. In most proof-of-stake systems stakeholders can automatically earn revenue just by running nodes with stake. Orchid has no such automatic mechanism, and has no inflation to fund staking. The only source of income on Orchid is customers paying for bandwidth. How can I earn passive revenue on my OXT? You can find an Orchid bandwidth provider who is seeking staking partners in exchange for a share of revenue or recurring payments - using any on-chain or off-chain mechanism. An Ethereum smart contract can be used to help automatically split revenue between a staker and a provider. The staker would stake on the smart contract, and the provider would direct client payments to the smart contract, which would then allow each party to withdraw some parameterized fraction of the funds. Note that any such delegated staking arrangement (even using on-chain mechanisms) can not guarantee that the provider will actually honor the contract: the provider could easily direct clients to a different payment address. And even if the provider is perfectly honest, there is still ultimately uncertainty in revenue and consequent return on stake. As an alternative to revenue sharing, providers could send recurring payments to the staker - essentially a stake rental or leasing arrangement. In this case the return is more predictable, but there is still no guarantee that the provider will make the scheduled payments. Again a smart contract could be used to help automate the payments, but can not guarantee the provider will have the necessary funds. There is always risk. When a staker decides to repoint their stake to a different provider, there is a lengthy withdrawal delay (currently about 3 months). So it is important for stakers to choose providers carefully. Stakers should start with small allocations and slowly increase them based on measured profitability. Eventually third party websites could provide an interface to help simplify and automate the process of finding, evaluating and staking on Orchid bandwidth providers.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#orchid-faq","text":"","title":"Orchid FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#security-and-privacy","text":"","title":"Security and Privacy"},{"location":"faq/#what-protections-does-the-orchid-app-provide","text":"Basic Internet connections function by transmitting packets of data between two hosts (computers). In order to find their way, packets contain both a source and destination IP address. As packets move from the destination to the source, different routers and physical infrastructure require both of these addresses for the two-way connection to be established and maintained. This means that instantly and over time, the owners of the physical infrastructure are in a position to build a profile of Internet usage on their paying user (you!) and also to block content as the owner sees fit. Typically these infrastructure owners are ISPs \u2014 mobile carriers providing phone data connections, home cable Internet providers, WiFi hotspot operators, and any Internet backbone operators that have peering agreements with user-facing ISPs. In all these cases, the ISP is in an advantaged position to monitor and/or restrict Internet usage. It is common in many countries for ISPs to restrict content so that users cannot load certain websites. If you are not happy with or do not trust your existing ISP(s), by using Orchid you can currently limit their knowledge to knowing only that you are sending and receiving bytes through Orchid, and completely block their ability to mess with the details of your traffic, unblocking the previously blocked content. They either block all of Orchid or nothing, so if things continue to work after turning on Orchid, then your ISP has allowed \"Orchid in general\" and cannot manipulate the individual bytes between you and the rest of the Internet, granting you access to the entire Internet.","title":"What protections does the Orchid app provide?"},{"location":"faq/#how-can-the-orchid-app-help-me-with-privacy-today","text":"The goal with the Orchid app is to give users insight and control over the network connection of their device. To gain privacy, users configure a circuit in Orchid by setting up an Orchid account and funding it with OXT. Then the Orchid app connects to the Orchid network and selects a node using Orchid\u2019s linear stake-weighted algorithm to serve as a VPN and pays for bandwidth via a continuous stream of tiny OXT nanopayments . In a single-hop circuit configuration, Orchid provides: Protection from websites seeing your real IP address and physical location Protection from your ISP seeing what websites you are visiting and when Access to the open Internet--once a user can connect to Orchid, they are not restricted by ISP level firewalls and can browse the entire Internet freely A potential problem with using only a single VPN provider is that the provider running the single node circuit knows both your IP address and the content you are accessing. If the provider maintains logs, those logs could be sold to advertisers or otherwise used against you. In the current VPN marketplace, it is hard to know who is maintaining logs and who is not. For Orchid nodes, we have developed a flexible curation system that gives users a way to pick whom to trust. Another solution is to trust no single provider with enough information to know both who you are and what information you are accessing. To that end, Orchid supports an advanced feature that allows users to configure multi-hop routes by stringing together multiple nodes into a flexible multi-hop circuit. Orchid currently supports several underlying protocols including the native Orchid VPN protocol and OpenVPN, allowing users to mix and match Orchid nodes with traditional VPN nodes. While the potential is there to protect the user from any one provider knowing enough information to reveal their circuit, this is an advanced feature that is currently \"use at your own risk\".","title":"How can the Orchid app help me with privacy today?"},{"location":"faq/#how-is-orchid-private-given-that-it-has-public-payments-on-ethereum","text":"The Orchid app pays for the circuit by sending a continuous stream of tiny nanopayments to providers for the duration of the connection. While the nanopayment architecture locks user funds into a smart contract and only issues on-chain payments to providers very rarely, occasional winning tickets do result in OXT macro-payments posted on the public Ethereum blockchain. When that happens, the user\u2019s Ethereum address, the provider\u2019s Ethereum address, and a timestamp are stored publically on the Ethereum blockchain. Note that the payment address of the provider is not a mapping to any single server; instead it is an arbitrary (and potentially temporary) payment address that the provider created specifically to receive funds. Also, the frequency of how often on-chain payments occur is configurable. All information gained by a potential network attacker is an advantage. However, consider exactly what information is revealed. For an Orchid user running a single hop circuit: the provider sees the user\u2019s payment address when it accepts service, along with the user\u2019s real IP address and the destination addresses that the user is connecting to (if it maintains logs). Once a rare on-chain payment is made, the user\u2019s payment address and provider\u2019s payment address are stored on Ethereum with a timestamp available to the public. When considering anonymity, it is important to understand if the user is linked to the OXT used in their circuit. Worst case, if the user purchased OXT on an exchange with their real identity, or the VPN provider used in the circuit maintained logs, then either of those two entities could be compelled to give information that could deanonymize the user. Similarly, a user who paid for a VPN service that maintained logs with a credit card could be deanonymized with just one entity being compelled. A multi-hop circuit affords greater network protections, but to setup a multi-hop Orchid circuit, it would be naive to pay for each hop from the same Ethereum wallet. In that configuration, each provider would be able to see that wallet\u2019s address and potentially use that address to get information about the user. To mitigate that, a better way to setup multi-hop circuits would be to use different wallet addresses for each Orchid hop. If every wallet address is independently dissociated from the user, the full circuit might be quite difficult to link back to the user. Again, multi-hop circuits in Orchid are an advanced feature; use at your own risk. Orchid is working on additional features to mitigate payment leakage, such as onion payment routing. The idea of this technique is to help obfuscate payments by routing them through several layers of indirection (paying Alice to pay Bob to pay Charlie). The payments then take a different random route than the traffic, preventing the rare occasional public payment records from indirectly revealing route information.","title":"How is Orchid private given that it has public payments on Ethereum?"},{"location":"faq/#can-orchid-nodes-monitor-network-traffic","text":"Yes, providers on Orchid could monitor the bytes that come in and out of the Orchid node. However, all traffic carried over Orchid between hops from the user to the exit is encrypted at the Orchid protocol level, which is an additional layer of encryption. The final exit traffic is then decrypted by the exit node and sent to the destination. In many cases the underlying traffic will also be encrypted with protocols such as TLS, providing at least two layers of encryption. However, not all traffic on the Internet is encrypted and Orchid doesn\u2019t fix that problem. The last hop configured in the active circuit will need to send the user requests out onto the Internet.

At its core, the dApp is a wrapper for the function calls of the smart contract with UI elements to help users make decisions for account makeup. The dApp interface will ask users to set their efficiency and number of max-sized tickets in their balance, so a familiarity with Orchid accounts is helpful to understand the terminology. Orchid Labs hosts the dApp at account.orchid.com DApp Overview The interface allows users to create and manage multiple Orchid accounts, although for most users only one account is necessary. When arriving at the interface for the first time, the create account screen will display with the controls inactive. Once a wallet is connected, the interface will activate for the Orchid account associated with that wallet. If multiple accounts exist, clicking on the purple Orchid logo at the top right will bring them up so one can be selected. The Add and Withdraw buttons at the top of the interface are how you can add funds or remove them from the selected account. The More tab provides a few more screens for navigation. Info: more details about the selected account Transactions: a list of transactions associated with the attached wallet Move Funds: a function to move funds from balance -> deposit Lock/Unlock Funds: a function to lock or unlock the deposit Advanced: a debugging output screen Connecting a wallet In order to make the dApp active, you will need to attach a funder wallet. The \u201cConnect\u201d button will pop-up your wallet options, depending on whether you are on desktop or mobile, and whether or not a wallet is detected. This step is similar to \u201clogging in\u201d in some sense, as the funder wallet you use to create the account is required to access and manage the account. The key supported wallet connection methods: Load the dApp in a dApp browser, such as MetaMask Mobile or Trust Wallet Use any desktop browser and then connect a mobile wallet with WalletConnect Use a desktop browser with MetaMask enabled as a web3 browser plugin Once the wallet is connected, you will see the address of that wallet displayed as the \u201cfunder wallet\u201d with the funds associated with that wallet appearing next to the address. All of the Orchid accounts created by that funder are available to manage. To disconnect a wallet, click on the purple Orchid logo in the upper right corner. That will pop open a menu with a Disconnect button. Create account To create an account, you will first need to have a wallet connected. Once that is complete, the interface will activate and you will see your funder wallet address displayed. The first step is to determine how much currency you will need to fund the account. The key decisions are how much to put into the deposit and how much to put into the balance. Signer address If you have created an Orchid signer in the Orchid app (Android-only feature labeled as \u201ccustom account creation\u201d), you can paste the public portion of the signer, the signer address, into the box. For most users, you will not have a signer keypair generated. No problem. Use the button to create the signer. Once the signer is created, the account exists in some sense, and you can now scan the QR code, or copy and paste the account into the app. It is a great idea to backup the account credentials at this time. A simple way to do that is to click the \u201cCopy\u201d button under the QR code, and then paste the account info into a password manager. NOTE: the account will have a zero balance until all three of these actions have happened: the transactions are submitted by pressing the \u201ccreate\u201d button, the transactions are approved by the attached wallet and the transactions have been confirmed by the blockchain. Efficiency slider to determine deposit size The efficiency slider shows what the payment efficiency will be for the current market conditions. The UI gathers the relevant information about the current price of the digital currencies and the amount of gas required for a provider to claim a payment, and then translates that into an efficiency metric. We recommend at least 50% efficiency, but that still means that 50% of your currency is going towards network fees. As you get into higher efficiency, the deposit size grows, but the amount paid to fees lessens. So there is a tradeoff between the total amount of money put into the deposit and the account efficiency. Because efficiency is coupled tightly with network transaction fees, it is useful to see if there is something abnormal happening with current Ethereum gas fees that could be causing the efficiencies of Orchid accounts to be rapidly changing. Size picker to determine balance size Due to the nature of the nanopayment system, the size of the balance needs some thought. Because payments are sent as probabilities of winning larger sums of money (what we call \u201clottery tickets\u201d) the balance needs to be large enough to make tickets that will be accepted by providers. Learn more about tickets here . Since the deposit is not used to pay for bandwidth, the amount of currency in your account that can be used for purchasing service is determined by the balance amount. As of now, the size of lottery tickets is half of the balance of the deposit. The size picker simply turns this into a plus and minus button, so you can pick how many tickets worth of balance you want in your account. You can always enter a number into the box as well. Our recommendation is to have a minimum of 3 tickets worth of balance. That helps even out the probabilities of the tickets over time, so that you don\u2019t experience too much variance. Add enough funds to your funder wallet Once you have used the interface to pick an efficiency and size, you will then know how much funds you will need to create the account. The amount is totaled right above the create button as \u201cTotal OXT\u201d as well as the \u201cNetwork fee ETH\u201d. You will need that amount of OXT and that amount of ETH in the funder wallet in order to enable the create account button. A current listing of exchanges where to buy OXT and ETH are listed here: https://www.orchid.com/oxt Funding the account Once there are enough funds in the attached funder wallet, the Create button will become available. Click Create! That will trigger 2 transactions to be submitted to the blockchain. The first one is an approval and will be less expensive than the second one, which is a push. Both need to successfully complete in order for the account to be usable and created properly. Both transactions will pop-up in the funder wallet and require approval, along with the payment for associated network fees. The first transaction to accept will be an approve call for the ERC-20 OXT token. This is relatively cheap, and is typically picked up fast by Ethereum. The second transaction is a push call to the Orchid nanopay contract. This is the more expensive function, and typically will require more gas and time. If your wallet supports increasing the gas limit for transactions, it is a good idea to use a higher gas limit for the second transaction so that it gets confirmed by the blockchain faster. Once the 2 transactions are approved and submitted to the blockchain, two purple banners will appear so you can keep track of the status of each transaction. Depending on the load on the current blockchain and the fees submitted with the two transactions, this can end up taking either a few minutes or many hours to complete. Blockchain tools such as Etherscan can be used to get an estimation on how long it will take. Multiple Account Management Once you have an Orchid account created, it will become selected in the interface and the UI elements will be relevant for that Orchid account. The information appearing on the Overview screen is relevant to that account, along with adding/withdrawing funds, etc. The Orchid dApp supports a single attached funder wallet to make multiple accounts. To access multiple accounts, click on the purple Orchid logo in the upper right to open the account list. From there you can create a new account and select between existing accounts. Add funds The Add Funds screen allows you to add funds to an existing account. In order to add funds to an account, the funder wallet of the account will need to be connected to the dApp interface. Clicking on Add Funds will bring up the interface. It is very similar to the account creation interface, except that the account has an existing balance and deposit. The efficiency slider and size picker will both help determine the amount of funds you need to add to the account. The total at the bottom of the interface is the amount of currency you will need in order to change the account makeup to be as selected in the interface. In addition to the currency that will be added to the balance and/or deposit, you will also need to pay the network fee. The recommendation is to have an efficiency of at least 50% and to have at least 3 tickets worth of balance. Once there is enough currency in the funder wallet, click the \u201cAdd Funds\u201d button to initiate the two transactions needed to add funds. The funder wallet needs to approve both transactions and then two purple banners will appear with the status of both of those transactions. Withdraw For the withdraw function to be available, a funder wallet will need to be connected first. The withdraw screen allows you to pull the currency out of the Balance and Deposit of the account to a wallet of your choice. If the deposit is still locked, only the balance will be able to be withdrawn. Note - if you are looking to withdraw everything from the account, the way to do this with the least amount of network fees is to unlock the Deposit and then withdraw the Balance and Deposit together. Then you only incur network fees for the unlock and withdraw, vs incurring fees for the withdraw twice. Once the Deposit is unlocked and the 24 hour cooling off period satisfied, the check box to \u201cWithdraw Full Balance and Deposit\u201d will be available. Lock/Unlock Funds The deposit of all Orchid accounts requires a 24 hour cooling off period before it can be withdrawn. The cooling off period gives enough time for providers to settle up any winning tickets they may have, and prevents double spending on the network. In order to withdraw the deposit, the deposit will first need to be unlocked using the Lock/Unlock Funds screen. Connect the funder wallet of the Orchid account to unlock and then click on the More menu in the upper right hand corner. There is a link for Lock/Unlock funds. That will open the interface.

Orchid DApp FAQs Why do I need a new Ethereum wallet? Why can\u2019t I use my main wallet? While you could use your primary Ethereum wallet that you typically use for other Ethereum applications, we do not recommend it if you are seeking privacy with Orchid. The main reason is that using Orchid results in on chain payments flowing from your wallet to the Orchid nanopayment contract, and then on to VPN providers selling bandwidth. Ethereum on-chain analytics can easily link payments to/from the nanopayment smart contract and then to providers. If the source of the funds comes from your personal Ethereum wallet linked to other services, anyone using Etherscan would be able to see that you used Orchid and sent payments to VPN providers, when the occasional Orchid nanopayment system issues a winning ticket. Why should I trust a big exchange with my personal info? Would a decentralized exchange that doesn\u2019t store my personal info be better? While a decentralized exchange does not store your personal information that could link your source of funds to your identity, a decentralized exchange does typically require an Ethereum account with some sort of crypto such as ETH, which has its own history of transactions. If that ETH or wallet is linked to your identity, then the source of funds could be linked through the DEX back to your originating Ethereum wallet. A large exchange typically has a ledger they use to keep track of ownership, with a hot wallet they use to send funds in and out of the exchange. While the exchange knows your identity, the movement of currency in and out of the exchange is anonymous, as the funds can\u2019t be tracked to your identity on the blockchain without the exchange being hacked, subpoenaed or otherwise compromised. Why do I need ETH and OXT? Orchid is a series of decentralized smart contracts and client software that uses Ethereum. Certain operations require the use of ETH for gas to power the smart contracts that run Orchid. For users who use the Orchid app, ETH is required when adding or removing funds from your Orchid account through the web3 browser interface.","title":"The Orchid DApp"},{"location":"orchid-dapp/#the-orchid-dapp","text":"The Orchid dApp is a hosted front-end for users to create and manage Orchid accounts so users don\u2019t need to interact with the smart contract directly.

The UI gathers the relevant information about the current price of the digital currencies and the amount of gas required for a provider to claim a payment, and then translates that into an efficiency metric. We recommend at least 50% efficiency, but that still means that 50% of your currency is going towards network fees. As you get into higher efficiency, the deposit size grows, but the amount paid to fees lessens. So there is a tradeoff between the total amount of money put into the deposit and the account efficiency. Because efficiency is coupled tightly with network transaction fees, it is useful to see if there is something abnormal happening with current Ethereum gas fees that could be causing the efficiencies of Orchid accounts to be rapidly changing.","title":"Efficiency slider to determine deposit size"},{"location":"orchid-dapp/#size-picker-to-determine-balance-size","text":"Due to the nature of the nanopayment system, the size of the balance needs some thought.

Learn more about tickets here . Since the deposit is not used to pay for bandwidth, the amount of currency in your account that can be used for purchasing service is determined by the balance amount. As of now, the size of lottery tickets is half of the balance of the deposit. The size picker simply turns this into a plus and minus button, so you can pick how many tickets worth of balance you want in your account. You can always enter a number into the box as well.

Both transactions will pop-up in the funder wallet and require approval, along with the payment for associated network fees. The first transaction to accept will be an approve call for the ERC-20 OXT token. This is relatively cheap, and is typically picked up fast by Ethereum. The second transaction is a push call to the Orchid nanopay contract. This is the more expensive function, and typically will require more gas and time. If your wallet supports increasing the gas limit for transactions, it is a good idea to use a higher gas limit for the second transaction so that it gets confirmed by the blockchain faster.

Access to an Orchid account is a requirement, as that is the payment account that pays the providers. Once you have an account, you can then set up the profile (typically done automatically) and hit the connect button to get VPN service. Access an Orchid account See set up an Orchid account on how to buy, create or get access to an Orchid account. Add the Orchid account to profile The Orchid account can be added to the client app by either scanning the QR code, or copy/pasting the account into the app. Look for the \u201cCopy\u201d button next to the QR code in the dApp which will copy the text of the account into your clipboard. If someone shares an account purely by text, you can also copy the account to the clipboard by highlighting the text of the account and hitting copy. Once you have the account information via QR or text, you can then go to Manage Profile -> New Hop -> Link Orchid Account which brings up the interface to either scan the QR code, or paste in the text from the clipboard. Connecting After attaching the account, you will end up back at the Home screen and can tap Connect to connect to one of the decentralized VPN providers. If there is a problem with an Orchid account used in the profile, a red exclamation mark will appear in the Manage Profile button. If this mark appears, the app will not be able to connect successfully to a provider. Read the Orchid account troubleshooting guide for help. After tapping connect, the Orchid app will do a number of things: * Show the \u201cConnecting\u201d status * Stop all internet traffic across the device (kill switch) * Go through the stake-weighted random selection to find a provider * Check to ensure that provider is in the Curator * Connect to the provider * If an error is hit, go back to 2 and re-try * Change the status from \u201cConnecting\u201d to \u201cConnected\u201d and change the screen state from white to purple Note that this process can sometimes take a few minutes, depending on the status of Orchid\u2019s providers. It is also possible to connect to a server, have the screen change states, and then have the connection die. Typically turning the app off/on can help kickstart the reconnect process whenever you experience no connectivity. Key concepts Orchid Accounts To access the Orchid network of providers, you need either Orchid Credits purchased with your native currency within the Orchid App (iOS/macOS only), or an Orchid Account created and funded using crypto currency with the dApp at account.orchid.com Credits can be purchased in the iOS or macOS app by hitting \u2018Buy Orchid Credits\u2019 in the notification area, or by going to \u2018Manage Profile\u2019, \u2018New Hop\u2019, and then \u2018Buy Orchid Account\u2019. While Orchid Credits are simpler to set up, creating an Orchid account using the dApp gives more control over the account, as purchased accounts are limited: there is no way to top-up, fix small deposits or to withdraw the funds from a purchased account. Jump to Orchid Accounts for more information. Hops Orchid \u2018hops\u2019 are VPN connections to the Internet. Examples include a connection to an Orchid node or an OpenVPN connection to an OpenVPN server. You can add and delete hops from the \u2018Manage Profile\u2019 screen within the Orchid App. Each hop will need a form of authentication to make a server connection. When multiple hops are added, internet traffic for the device goes through each server from top to bottom. To add a hop in the Orchid Client, go to \u2018Manage Profile\u2019 and click \u2018New Hop\u2019. From here, you can choose to: * Buy an Orchid Account (iOS/macOS only feature) * Link an Orchid Account * Create a Custom Account (Android only feature) * Enter an OpenVPN config using your credentials * Enter a WireGuard config Orchid has its own VPN wireline protocol, the Orchid protocol. The traffic to and from Orchid nodes uses the Orchid protocol. The traffic appears as webRTC traffic, which is advantageous for security and includes tiny nanopyments that flow with the traffic. Each Orchid node also has a Curator \u2014 this is the curated list that is associated with the hop. When a connection is initiated, the Curator creates a subset of the available Orchid nodes for the hop to create the connection. The main component of the Orchid node is the Orchid account associated with it. Each Orchid hop requires a valid Orchid account to continue to pay for VPN service. Profile Manager To access the profile manager, hit \u2018Manage Profile\u2019 on the Orchid home / status screen. The profile manager is used to organize hops into the \u201cprofile\u201d that your device will use to connect to the Internet. A typical VPN user only needs one hop. Hops can be mixed and matched here to form your own custom-styled circuits. For example, you could configure a profile with three different Orchid hops, so that your Internet traffic passes through three different servers between your device and the server you are accessing. On this screen, you\u2019ll also see \u2018View Deleted Hops\u2019 at the bottom. This is an easy way to restore recently removed hops. There is currently no way to save profiles, nor an easy way to switch between them. The profile manager allows you to only modify the active profile at any given time. If you delete hops, they are still saved and available to be restored. How to create an Orchid hop To use Orchid's decentralized providers, you will need to add an Orchid hop to your profile. The WireGuard and OpenVPN options are for making connections to existing servers where you have login credentials. Orchid hops will use the attached Orchid account to send payments and then connect to a random provider on the network. From the Manage Profile screen, tap \"New Hop\" and then select an option: Buy an Orchid account (iOS/macOS only) In the iOS and macOS app, you can simply buy a pre-created Orchid account. These accounts come in 3 different sizes and are pre-filled with funds. The purchased accounts can only connect to our list of preferred providers . Purchased accounts are custodied by Orchid. There is no current way to add funds to them. Email contact@orchid.com for help with purchased accounts. Linking an Orchid account If you have created an Orchid account in the dApp, you can tap Link Orchid Account to simply scan in the QR code. The other option is to copy the text of the account into your clipboard and then tap the Paste option to read in the account that way. Orchid accounts are shareable, so if your friend sends you a QR code or the text of their account, you can link the account and use it by using the Link Orchid Account option. Create a custom account The custom account option is in the Android app only. With this option you can generate a signer key and use that with your funder wallet to fund the account in the dApp. To create a custom account: * Tap Create Custom Account from the New Hop menu * Paste in the public address of your funder wallet * Select \"Generate new key\" * Tap Save in the upper right * Tap the Orchid hop from the Profile Manager * Tap Copy next to the signer address * Paste the signer address into the dApp on the Create Account flow The last step will fund the empty account that was created in the app. How to restore deleted hops To restore deleted hops, go to \u2018Manage Profile\u2019 from the home / status screen. At the bottom you\u2019ll see a link to \u2018View Deleted Hops\u2019. You\u2019ll need to: * Click into the hop you want to restore * Hit \u2018Share Orchid Account\u2019 and hit \u2018Copy\u2019 * Return to the \u2018Manage Profile\u2019 screen, click \u2018New Hop\u2019 then \u2018Link Orchid Account\u2019 and \u2018Paste\u2019 * Your deleted hop will now appear at the bottom of your list of hops A note on multiple hops Orchid supports the use of multiple hops, allowing your Internet connection to be routed through an arbitrary number of VPN servers before reaching its destination. For more information about the implications of multiple hops, refer to the FAQ section on Security. Different protocols can be used with the multiple hop feature. For example, you could set up your traffic to go to three different Orchid servers, three different WireGuard servers or a combination therein. Using traditional VPN connections OpenVPN To use an OpenVPN hop, you\u2019ll need your username, password and configuration file from your VPN provider. You can usually find these in your provider VPN account under manual configuration or OpenVPN configuration. To use your OpenVPN configuration, go to \u2018Manage Profile\u2019 and \u2018New Hop\u2019 then \u2018Enter OpenVPN Config\u2019. WireGuard To use your OpenVPN configuration, go to \u2018Manage Profile\u2019 and \u2018New Hop\u2019 then \u2018Enter WireGuard Config\u2019. Paste your WireGuard configuration into the text box and tap save in the upper right corner. The WireGuard account will now become an active hop available at the manage profile screen. Using the traffic monitor Orchid has a built-in traffic monitor that can run with or without an Orchid account. Using the traffic monitor is similar to WireShark--and Orchid works on iOS! The traffic monitor also works across every platform that Orchid supports. There are two ways to enable the traffic monitor: * If you have a connection with at least one hop set up, when your connection is active you will be able to use the traffic monitor * If you have no hops set up, you can go to \u2018Settings\u2019 and then you can enable \u2018Allow No Hop VPN\u2019 Once it\u2019s enabled, you can find the traffic monitor from the home screen by opening the menu from the icon on the top left of the screen. \u2018Traffic Monitor\u2019 is at the bottom of the menu. Filters Enter a hostname or partial hostname into the search bar to show only matching rows. Enter multiple terms separated by a space to combine hostname filters using \u201cAND\u201d logic. e.g. \u201cgoog api\u201d will match rows including both \u201cgoog\u201d and \u201capi\u201d, such as \u201capi1.google.com\u201d. Use a \u201c-\u201d minus sign to exclude terms. e.g. \u201c-goog\u201d will show all hostnames except those matching \u201cgoog\u201d. You can mix these to include and exclude combinations such as: \u201cgoogle -api\u201d to find all \u201cgoogle\u201d entries excluding those with \u201capi\u201d. Use \u201cprot: \u201dto filter by protocol name. e.g. \u201cprot:imap\u201d will match all traffic identified as \u201cimap\u201d connections and \u201c-prot:dns\u201d will filter out all DNS queries from the results. Gathering Logs When debugging client-side issues, you might be requested to share logs. These logs provide advanced details about what the Orchid client is doing behind the scenes to provide you with a private browsing experience. This page is designed to help you collect and share the logs. Android Prerequisites Start by turning on developer and debugging mode on the phone by going to Settings -> About Phone -> About Software and tapping on the build number repeatedly until it prompts you to enable developer mode. Then go to Settings -> Developer Settings -> Turn on USB Debugging . Finally, you can run the following command on your computer with your phone connected via USB to view the logs. Android and iOS Prerequisites When you connect your device to your computer, it will prompt you to trust the computer. It is important that you do so. Otherwise, you will be unable to collect logs. Cydia Impactor The easiest way to gather logs from both iOS and Android devices is through Cydia Impactor . In the main window, use the select box to pick the correct device (if you only have one mobile device connected to your computer, this will be done for you). Next, go to Device -> Watch Log... . A terminal window will appear and it will start to show a streaming syslog from your mobile device. adb logcat (Android) If you are using an Android device, you can alternatively collect logs through the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). You can follow this guide to install adb on Windows, macOS, or Linux. Once installed, you can run the following command in a terminal to view the logs: adb logcat Sanitizing the Logs The logs you gather will contain information from all applications and actions taken on your device during the period that logs are being gathered. These are not all necessary for debugging purposes. You can optionally filter out all lines that do not contain the string orchid as a quick way to sanitize the output. You can do this with a command like: grep -i 'orchid' client.log Where client.log is the file containing the syslog output from the device. You should also be careful to filter out your various secret keys from the logs: grep -vi 'secret' client.log Sharing the Logs The logs you gather will be quite long. You almost certainly do not want to paste them in their entirety into something like a Telegram message. Instead, we encourage you to either share them as an attachment via your preferred method of communication. Or if you are using a communication platform that doesn't support attachments, you can utilize a private pastebin service such as GitHub Gists , which will provide you with a secret URL you can share to grant access to your logs. Orchid App troubleshooting/FAQs Help, my Internet connection shut off after I turned Orchid on Orchid has a built-in \u201ckill switch\u201d and so turning Orchid on will destroy all existing connections to the Internet and force them to go through Orchid. If Orchid is trying to connect, the Internet will be shut off until a connection is established. This is a feature that ensures that none of your Internet traffic will accidentally leak due to a disconnect/reconnect without you pressing the button first. This ensures that when you hit \u201cconnect\u201d your traffic is now only going through Orchid. Read Connecting for more information on exactly what happens when you hit connect.
